# Keiran Hollenbeck Accessibility Assignment

Welcome to my Accessibility assignment. The site will direct you to the home page where you will run into 3 videos, each video has the option to priview subtitles on it. Underneath each video, there will be a button that will lead the user to another page that has the transcript of the video and it's timestamp of where it is taking place. The functionality is keyboard and screen reader friendly for those that are only able to use keyboard. The color contrast for the buttons makes it easier to read for those who have poor sight.
