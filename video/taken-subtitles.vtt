I don't know who you are.

00:08.181 --> 00:09.606
I don't know what you want.

00:10.441 --> 00:11.911
If you are looking for ransom,

00:12.416 --> 00:14.061
I can tell you, I don't have money.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.737
But, what I do have,

00:16.319 --> 00:18.459
are a very particular set of skills.

00:19.385 --> 00:21.615
Skills I have acquired over a very long career,

00:22.345 --> 00:24.945
skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

00:30.307 --> 00:31.767
I will not look for you,

00:32.069 --> 00:33.564
I will not pursue you.

00:34.237 --> 00:35.607

00:41.094 --> 00:43.094
and I will kill you.

00:47.245 --> 00:48.770
