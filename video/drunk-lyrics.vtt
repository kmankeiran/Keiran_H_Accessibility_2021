WEBVTT - Drunk Lyrics

00:08.382 --> 00:09.318
Just one drink!

00:09.435 --> 00:10.676
Gonna keep it mellow.

00:10.676 --> 00:12.799
Responsible night for a polite fellow.

00:12.799 --> 00:15.089
Say hello to my friends and comrades.

00:15.089 --> 00:17.054
Don't tend to offend, so I say perhaps.

00:17.054 --> 00:17.954
Just two drinks!

00:17.962 --> 00:19.402
as a social courtesy.

00:19.402 --> 00:21.402
We can raise a glass to our past fraternity.

00:21.402 --> 00:23.800
And certainly a perfectly normal informal get together,

00:23.800 --> 00:25.730
but it’s been forever since we gathered, so whatever.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.562
Just three drinks!

00:26.562 --> 00:27.939
For the sake of the old times.

00:27.939 --> 00:30.030
Proceed with tequila shots with a dish full of cold limes.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.350
The whole nine, laughing remembering all the old lines.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.186
Never used to work but I could give 'em another try.

00:34.186 --> 00:35.110
Just four drinks!

00:35.110 --> 00:36.437
Y’know, take the edge off.

00:36.446 --> 00:38.446
I've had a hard week, I deserve to get sauced.

00:38.446 --> 00:40.820
Pick up another round as my friends depart, and

00:40.825 --> 00:42.889
they may not stick around, but I just got started.

00:43.305 --> 00:45.811
Feel so much better than usual

00:45.811 --> 00:48.650
I feel indisputable

00:49.151 --> 00:51.356
OHHHH

00:51.856 --> 00:54.738
I think that I might be beautiful

00:55.305 --> 00:56.495
Juuust five drinks!

00:56.611 --> 00:57.751
F**kin' treat myself!

00:57.751 --> 01:00.065
Pour the Dom Perignon from the back of the top shelf.

01:00.131 --> 01:01.984
Spend like god, put on airs to sell it.

01:01.984 --> 01:04.200
Crowd pretends not to care, but I know they're jealous.

01:04.225 --> 01:05.032
Just six drinks!

01:05.032 --> 01:06.309
Let's slip the dogs of war!

01:06.309 --> 01:08.682
Gonna start a f**kin' riot 'till I'm tossed out the front door.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.467
Zero to sixty, I can turn on a dime,

01:10.467 --> 01:12.740
I'm hitting bottom and I'm feeling like committing a crime.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.846
Just eight drinks!

01:13.846 --> 01:14.846
Maybe I've lost count?

01:14.854 --> 01:17.133
I can't remember the night, what I drank, or the amount.

01:17.134 --> 01:18.116
I'm fading in and out,

01:18.116 --> 01:19.980
my very consciousness is crumbling....

01:20.439 --> 01:21.611
Sorry, was I saying something?

01:21.612 --> 01:22.389
Twelve drinks!

01:22.389 --> 01:23.637
Strolling out of the hospital.

01:23.637 --> 01:25.782
Is it hair of the dog if you say drunk it don't stop at all?

01:25.776 --> 01:27.830
Another night losing it more than I can afford.

01:27.830 --> 01:30.226
Was I just feeling bored? Am I that insecure?

01:30.551 --> 01:32.967
Feels so much better than usual.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.893
I feel indisputable.

01:36.376 --> 01:38.768
OHHHHH

01:39.082 --> 01:41.473
But now I’m feeling so beautiful.

01:41.711 --> 01:45.154
Don't wake me up from this spell I'm under,

01:45.284 --> 01:47.284
if I'm still breathing.

01:47.395 --> 01:50.231
I know that I will be ugly when

01:50.231 --> 01:52.838
I feel like myself again.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.588
OHHHH

01:56.179 --> 01:59.149
But now I'm feeling so beautiful.

02:00.009 --> 02:02.113
Bottle of scotch served on the rocks with a shot of cachaca.

02:02.113 --> 02:04.406
Vodka sake kamikaze with a handle of sherry a

02:04.465 --> 02:06.465
cherry brandy with a jaeger chaser champagne float.

02:06.548 --> 02:08.548
A bourbon hot toddy in teacup of throat coat.

02:08.623 --> 02:10.938
Martini bellini negroni baileys kahlua sambuca.

02:11.002 --> 02:13.002
Soju paloma mojito gimlet frangelico guinness.

02:13.025 --> 02:14.935
Tequila manhattan a margarita old fashioned.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.230
Dry vermouth and something I can’t taste 'cause I’m so trashed.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.300
Soldiering over I’m slower shoulder to shoulder with no one,

02:19.347 --> 02:21.232
stumbling sobering making friends with a smoker.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.260
I know I’m less than upright, losing the fight with the ground.

02:23.441 --> 02:25.784
Then someone hits the lights as they close for the night now.

02:25.784 --> 02:27.767
Try to look at heaven and I can’t see the stars.

02:27.779 --> 02:30.010
A billion trillion eyes are winking as I walk between parked cars.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.015
Metabolizing liquor while I’m losing my friends.

02:32.015 --> 02:34.334
I’m gonna hate myself tomorrow, then I’ll do it again.

02:34.334 --> 02:35.831
Naa na na na naa

02:35.850 --> 02:38.150
na na na na na naa na

02:38.318 --> 02:42.808
*CHORUS*

02:43.098 --> 02:45.889
Feel so much better than usual.

02:46.027 --> 02:48.400
I feel indisputable.

02:49.314 --> 02:51.314
OHHHH

02:51.855 --> 02:53.985
But now I'm feeling so beautiful.

02:54.467 --> 02:58.214
Don’t wake me up from this spell I’m under,

02:58.228 --> 03:00.228
if I’m still breathing.

03:00.351 --> 03:03.065
I know that I will be ugly when

03:03.146 --> 03:05.566
I feel like myself again.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.550
OHHHH

03:09.113 --> 03:11.113
But now I’m feeling so beautiful.

03:11.751 --> 03:13.751
My vision is blurry,

03:13.778 --> 03:15.778
as long as I’m thirsty,

03:15.991 --> 03:18.038
nobody can hurt me.

03:18.038 --> 03:19.157
Hurt me.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.575
Hurt me...
