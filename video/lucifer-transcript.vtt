WEBVTT - Lucifer Transcript

00:01.170 --> 00:01.935
Again...

00:02.488 --> 00:04.488
*A gun is cocked and aimed at Lucifer's head.*

00:07.200 --> 00:09.445
Have I played that song too much?

00:10.742 --> 00:12.372
I have, haven't I?

00:13.515 --> 00:15.515
*Lucifer turns towards the masked thieves*

00:14.729 --> 00:19.137
Still, there are far less drastic ways to put in a new song request.

00:19.363 --> 00:20.293
What's your poison?

00:20.703 --> 00:21.548
Poison?

00:22.308 --> 00:23.093
ABBA?

00:23.778 --> 00:25.163
*Thief*
Revenge

00:25.404 --> 00:27.214
*Lucifer*
I'm not familiar.

00:27.217 --> 00:29.017
But if you hum a few bars, I bet I can keep up.

00:29.189 --> 00:31.189
*The thief takes off his mask to reveal who he is.*

00:32.450 --> 00:37.000
Well, if it isn't Mr. "Saidout bitch"

00:34.331 --> 00:36.331
*Lucifer slowly gets up from his chair.*

00:37.205 --> 00:40.743
I'm glad to see you've recovered from your adventures in the desert.

00:39.645 --> 00:41.645
*Lucifer walks towards his bar while the gun is still pointed at him.*

00:40.929 --> 00:42.789
*Thief*
I almost died, because of you.

00:43.072 --> 00:45.747
*Lucifer*
You were driving a stolen Brinks truck, full of cash.

00:46.193 --> 00:49.030
Because of me, you're not in jail forever.

00:49.220 --> 00:51.220
*Lucifer grabs a bottle of scotch.*

00:50.223 --> 00:50.913
You're welcome.

00:50.971 --> 00:52.971
*Thief*
I was walking around in the desert for days.

00:53.684 --> 00:55.164
I barely survived.

00:55.453 --> 00:58.003
It got so bad, that I started hallucinating.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.006
I-I remember you having wings.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.450
*Lucifer*
You remember correctly.

01:00.876 --> 01:06.876
*Lucifer pours himself two glasses and drinks both of them.*

01:03.245 --> 01:05.245
But I'm different now.

01:05.794 --> 01:08.322
*Thief*
I don't know what that means, and I don't care.

01:08.761 --> 01:10.216
I needed that money.

01:10.674 --> 01:12.404
You know, I did my research on you.

01:12.627 --> 01:13.962
You're loaded.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.330
So pay up.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.087
*Lucifer*
I think your research may have been a little...

01:17.689 --> 01:19.689
*Lucifer grabs the end of the gun and crushes it.*

01:20.247 --> 01:21.607
..Inadequate 

01:21.861 --> 01:23.106
*The thief drops the gun and is confused.*

01:23.287 --> 01:25.287
*Lucifer's eyes start to glow red.*

01:25.700 --> 01:27.700
*He picks up the thief and lifts him off his legs.*

01:27.545 --> 01:29.090
*Thief*
I didn't hallucinate, did I?

01:29.463 --> 01:32.463
*Lucifer*
What do you feel? Confusion?

01:32.627 --> 01:33.647
Disgust?

01:34.492 --> 01:35.367
Terror?

01:35.694 --> 01:36.854
*Thief*
Mostly terror.

01:37.016 --> 01:38.866
*Lucifer*
I wonder if that's what she felt.

01:39.397 --> 01:40.047
*Thief*
Who?

01:39.953 --> 01:46.953
*The 4 other masked thieves surrounding him start to open fire. The bullets have no effect on Lucifer.*

01:47.787 --> 01:49.787
*Lucifer*
The detective, of course.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.460
*Lucifer drops the first thief to the ground.*

01:51.269 --> 01:52.569
*Thief 2 yells*

01:51.269 --> 01:52.927
*Thief 2 starts to attack Lucifer. Lucifer blocks his punch and it launches the thief far back.*

01:52.927 --> 01:54.927
*Thief 2 collides with Thief 4 and they both fall onto the ground.*

01:53.218 --> 01:56.072
*Lucifer*
You see, recently, she discovered my true nature.

01:56.102 --> 01:56.747
*Thief 3 yells*

01:57.331 --> 01:59.331
*Lucifer grabs Thief 3's throat as he was charging Lucifer.*

01:57.828 --> 02:01.338
*Lucifer*
And in that moment, as I waited to see what her reaction would be...

02:00.919 --> 02:02.919
*Lucifer throws Thief 3 all the way to the other side of the club with his superhuman strength.*

02:01.876 --> 02:03.876
*Thief 3 screams*

02:04.335 --> 02:05.789
*Thief 3 hits the ground hard and is knocked unconscious.*

02:05.747 --> 02:08.367
*Lucifer*
..the police streamed in, pulled her away.

02:08.384 --> 02:10.049
I mean, she'd been shot after all.

02:08.679 --> 02:09.884
*Thief 1 is looking at Lucifer in fear.*

02:09.900 --> 02:11.900
*Thief 4 runs towards Lucifer and manages to hit Lucifer in the face. Lucifer is unfazed by the punch.*

02:10.048 --> 02:12.538
*Thief 4 yells*

02:12.709 --> 02:16.035
*Lucifer grabs Thief 4 and he struggles to break free.*

02:13.671 --> 02:14.506
She was gone.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.459
She'd left Los Angeles, on a vacation.

02:17.868 --> 02:19.868
*Lucifer throws Thief 4, he hits the wall and is knocked unconscious.*

02:18.485 --> 02:19.490
*Thief 4 grunts*

02:20.326 --> 02:21.521
That was a month ago.

02:21.697 --> 02:25.527
I've been telling myself she's 
simply processing what she learned.

02:22.113 --> 02:24.113
*Thief 2 slowly gets back up and pulls out a knife.*

02:25.558 --> 02:27.558
*Thief 2 yells*

02:25.689 --> 02:28.182
*Thief 2 charges at Lucifer with the knife. Lucifer grabs Thief 2's wrist and breaks it.*

02:27.645 --> 02:29.645
*Thief 2 screams in pain*

02:28.430 --> 02:29.940
*While still holding the knife, Lucifer pushes Thief 2's arm towards his leg, making Thief 2 stab himself.*

02:29.964 --> 02:31.964
*Lucifer grabs Thief 2's jacket and throws him at the bar. Thief 2 is knocked unconscious.

02:31.989 --> 02:36.327
I mean, it can be quite jarring to discover someone's actually the devil.

02:35.534 --> 02:37.534
*Lucifer's eyes start to glow red for a brief period again.*

02:37.180 --> 02:39.210
What if she's already made up her mind?

02:39.264 --> 02:44.264
What if she's decided that I am evil incarnate?

02:44.671 --> 02:46.671
*Lucifer slowly walks closer to Thief 1 until they are face to face.*

02:48.904 --> 02:50.904
And what if she's right?

02:49.021 --> 02:51.021
*Thief 1 is afraid of Lucifer.*

02:52.417 --> 02:54.212
*Thief 1*
Don't kill me man. Please.

02:54.231 --> 02:57.624
I-I'm just a thief. That's all.

03:00.366 --> 03:02.366
*Lucifer*
That's not true.

03:03.089 --> 03:05.089
*Thief 1*
E-Excuse me?

03:06.219 --> 03:07.984
*Lucifer*
That's not all you are.

03:08.499 --> 03:11.331
Don't get me wrong, you are indeed a thief.

03:08.793 --> 03:10.793
*The scene jump cuts into Lucifer's room with lots of money and gold.*

03:11.331 --> 03:15.000
But perhaps you deserve a chance to prove 
to people that's not all you are.

03:11.367 --> 03:23.081
*Lucifer starts giving Thief 1 as much money gold as he can carry. Thief 1 is really confused why Lucifer is doing this.*

03:16.119 --> 03:17.058
Alright, here you go.

03:17.059 --> 03:20.611
Money to cover any debts that you owe.

03:20.739 --> 03:23.318
Pay for your friends downstairs' medical bills.

03:23.332 --> 03:25.332
And have a chance at a new life.

03:25.381 --> 03:30.333
A chance for people to see you, in a different way.

03:27.677 --> 03:29.677
*Lucifer puts a crown on Thief 1's head.*

03:31.230 --> 03:33.230
*Thief*
This is a trick, right?

03:32.197 --> 03:34.197
*Money slips from Thief 1's arms and falls to the ground.* 

03:33.995 --> 03:36.226
*Lucifer*
You need a show of faith on top of all this?

03:36.344 --> 03:36.912
Very well. 

03:37.462 --> 03:41.732
Since I left you trouserless on our last two encounters,
 how about I balance the scales?

03:37.792 --> 03:41.613
*Lucifer starts to unbuckle his belt and take off his pants.*

03:42.312 --> 03:44.312
*Lucifer gives Thief 1 his pants. Thief 1 stares at the pant-less Lucifer.*

03:44.109 --> 03:46.904
*Thief*
Ooookay, um.

03:47.571 --> 03:50.331
We're even now...sort of.

03:50.884 --> 03:52.384
Could I just go now?

03:53.240 --> 03:55.240
*Lucifer*
Absolutely.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.206
*Thief 1 starts to exit the building. Mazikeen walks in and the 2 of them walk past each other.*

03:56.735 --> 03:57.130
*Mazikeen*
Sup?

03:57.121 --> 03:57.781
*Thief*
Sup?

03:58.260 --> 03:59.730
*Mazikeen*
Hey.

03:59.633 --> 04:01.633
*Mazikeen stares at Lucifer's bottom half as he still has no pants on.*

04:00.195 --> 04:01.615
Hey stranger.
