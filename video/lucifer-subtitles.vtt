WEBVTT - Lucifer Subtitles

00:01.170 --> 00:01.935
Again...

00:07.200 --> 00:09.445
Have I played that song too much?

00:10.742 --> 00:12.372
I have, haven't I?

00:14.729 --> 00:19.137
Still, there are far less drastic ways to put in a new song request.

00:19.363 --> 00:20.293
What's your poison?

00:20.703 --> 00:21.548
Poison?

00:22.308 --> 00:23.093
ABBA?

00:23.778 --> 00:25.163
*Thief*
Revenge

00:25.404 --> 00:27.214
*Lucifer*
I'm not familiar.

00:27.217 --> 00:29.017
But if you hum a few bars, I bet I can keep up.

00:32.450 --> 00:37.000
Well, if it isn't Mr. "Saidout bitch"

00:37.205 --> 00:40.743
I'm glad to see you've recovered from your adventures in the desert.

00:40.929 --> 00:42.789
*Thief*
I almost died, because of you.

00:43.072 --> 00:45.747
*Lucifer*
You were driving a stolen Brinks truck, full of cash.

00:46.193 --> 00:49.030
Because of me, you're not in jail forever.

00:50.223 --> 00:50.913
You're welcome.

00:50.971 --> 00:52.971
*Thief*
I was walking around in the desert for days.

00:53.684 --> 00:55.164
I barely survived.

00:55.453 --> 00:58.003
It got so bad, that I started hallucinating.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.006
I-I remember you having wings.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.450
*Lucifer*
You remember correctly.

01:03.245 --> 01:05.245
But I'm different now.

01:05.794 --> 01:08.322
*Thief*
I don't know what that means, and I don't care.

01:08.761 --> 01:10.216
I needed that money.

01:10.674 --> 01:12.404
You know, I did my research on you.

01:12.627 --> 01:13.962
You're loaded.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.330
So pay up.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.087
*Lucifer*
I think your research may have been a little...

01:20.247 --> 01:21.607
..Inadequate 

01:27.545 --> 01:29.090
*Thief*
I didn't hallucinate, did I?

01:29.463 --> 01:32.463
*Lucifer*
What do you feel? Confusion?

01:32.627 --> 01:33.647
Disgust?

01:34.492 --> 01:35.367
Terror?

01:35.694 --> 01:36.854
*Thief*
Mostly terror.

01:37.016 --> 01:38.866
*Lucifer*
I wonder if that's what she felt.

01:39.397 --> 01:40.047
*Thief*
Who?

01:47.787 --> 01:49.787
*Lucifer*
The detective, of course.

01:51.269 --> 01:52.569
*Thief 2 yells*

01:53.218 --> 01:56.072
*Lucifer*
You see, recently, she discovered my true nature.

01:56.102 --> 01:56.747
*Thief 3 yells*

01:57.828 --> 02:01.338
*Lucifer*
And in that moment, as I waited to see what her reaction would be...

02:01.876 --> 02:03.876
*Thief 3 screams*

02:05.747 --> 02:08.367
*Lucifer*
..the police streamed in, pulled her away.

02:08.384 --> 02:10.049
I mean, she'd been shot after all.

02:10.048 --> 02:12.538
*Thief 4 yells*

02:13.671 --> 02:14.506
She was gone.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.459
She'd left Los Angeles, on a vacation.

02:18.485 --> 02:19.490
*Thief 4 grunts*

02:20.326 --> 02:21.521
That was a month ago.

02:21.697 --> 02:25.527
I've been telling myself she's 
simply processing what she learned.

02:25.558 --> 02:27.558
*Thief 2 yells*

02:27.645 --> 02:29.645
*Thief 2 screams in pain*

02:31.989 --> 02:36.327
I mean, it can be quite jarring to discover someone's actually the devil.

02:37.180 --> 02:39.210
What if she's already made up her mind?

02:39.264 --> 02:44.264
What if she's decided that I am evil incarnate?

02:48.904 --> 02:50.904
And what if she's right?

02:52.417 --> 02:54.212
*Thief 1*
Don't kill me man. Please.

02:54.231 --> 02:57.624
I-I'm just a thief. That's all.

03:00.366 --> 03:02.366
*Lucifer*
That's not true.

03:03.089 --> 03:05.089
*Thief 1*
E-Excuse me?

03:06.219 --> 03:07.984
*Lucifer*
That's not all you are.

03:08.499 --> 03:11.331
Don't get me wrong, you are indeed a thief.

03:11.331 --> 03:15.000
But perhaps you deserve a chance to prove 
to people that's not all you are.

03:16.119 --> 03:17.058
Alright, here you go.

03:17.059 --> 03:20.611
Money to cover any debts that you owe.

03:20.739 --> 03:23.318
Pay for your friends downstairs' medical bills.

03:23.332 --> 03:25.332
And have a chance at a new life.

03:25.381 --> 03:30.333
A chance for people to see you, in a different way.

03:31.230 --> 03:33.230
*Thief*
This is a trick, right?

03:33.995 --> 03:36.226
*Lucifer*
You need a show of faith on top of all this?

03:36.344 --> 03:36.912
Very well. 

03:37.462 --> 03:41.732
Since I left you trouserless on our last two encounters,
 how about I balance the scales?

03:44.109 --> 03:46.904
*Thief*
Ooookay, um.

03:47.571 --> 03:50.331
We're even now...sort of.

03:50.884 --> 03:52.384
Could I just go now?

03:53.240 --> 03:55.240
*Lucifer*
Absolutely.

03:56.735 --> 03:57.130
*Mazikeen*
Sup?

03:57.121 --> 03:57.781
*Thief*
Sup?

03:58.260 --> 03:59.730
*Mazikeen*
Hey.

04:00.195 --> 04:01.615
Hey stranger.
